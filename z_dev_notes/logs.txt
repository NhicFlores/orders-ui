deleted existing tables in vercel postgres 
ran npx drizzle-kit push 
successfully created all tables, however, 'order-handling' schema was not created 

dbSchema does not work for vercel postgres, though it works for the dockerized pg database 

for vercel postgres => schema.ts export const createTable = pgTableCreator((name) => `image-gallery_${name}`);
        drizzle.config.ts : export default { schema: , dialect: , dbCredentials: , tablesFilter: ["image-gallery_*"], } satisfies Config; 
    - this just makes table names with a standardized prefix: all tables exist in the same schema, but the tablesFilter param 
    gets only the tables with the specified prefix
