creating new order form
new 'create' route in orders folder 
    'create' folder with page.tsx

    import Form from '@/app/ui/order/create-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/order/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  const customers = await fetchCustomers();
  //customers for dropdown menu 
  return (
    <main>
      <Breadcrumbs
        breadcrumbs={[
          { label: 'Orders', href: '/dashboard/orders' },
          {
            label: 'Create Order',
            href: '/dashboard/orders/create',
            active: true,
          },
        ]}
      />
      <Form customers={customers} />
    </main>
  );
}

<form> has: input, dropdown, input of type number and radio, cancel, and submit 

create a  actions.ts in app/lib 
   'use server';
    export async function createOrder(formData: FormData) {} 

import this function in form component and add the action attribute 
<form action={createOrder}> asdfa f </form>

Good to know: In HTML, you'd pass a URL to the action attribute. This URL would be the destination where your form data should be submitted (usually an API endpoint).

However, in React, the action attribute is considered a special prop - meaning React builds on top of it to allow actions to be invoked.

Behind the scenes, Server Actions create a POST API endpoint. This is why you don't need to create API endpoints manually when using Server Actions.


updating an order 
	create new dynamic route segment with the order id 
	read the order id from the page params 
	fetch the specific order from db 
	pre-populate the form with the order data 
	update the order data in db
