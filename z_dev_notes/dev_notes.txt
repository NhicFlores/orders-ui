------------------------------------ Web Dev Concepts ---------------------------------- 
Two environments code runs on: client and server 
  Client is browser on user device that sends requests to a server. 
  Server receives requests and sends responses back to client 

Request-Response Lifecycle 
-User Action: The user interacts with a web application. This could be clicking a link, 
submitting a form, or typing a URL directly into the browser's address bar.
-HTTP Request: The client sends an HTTP request to the server that contains necessary information 
about what resources are being requested, what method is being used (e.g. GET, POST), and additional data if necessary.
-Server: The server processes the request and responds with the appropriate resources. This process 
may take a couple of steps like routing, fetching data, etc.
-HTTP Response: After processing the request, the server sends an HTTP response back to the client. 
This response contains a status code (which tells the client whether the request was successful or not) and requested 
resources (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, static assets, etc).
-Client: The client parses the resources to render the user interface.
-User Action: Once the user interface is rendered, the user can interact with it, and the whole process starts again.

In web development, the Network Boundary is a conceptual line that separates the different environments. For example, 
the client and the server, or the server and the data store.

In React, you choose where to place the client-server network boundary wherever it makes the most sense.

Behind the scenes, the work is split into two parts: the client module graph and the server module graph. The server 
module graph contains all the components that are rendered on the server, and the client module graph contains all 
components that are rendered on the client.

It may be helpful to think about module graphs as a visual representation of how files in your application depend on each other.

You can use the React "use client" convention to define the boundary. There's also a "use server" convention, which 
tells React to do some computational work on the server.

------------------------------------ REACT CORE ------------------------------------
React 

Props
To collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead. The parent component can pass that state back down to the children via props. This keeps the child components in sync with each other and with their parent.

State
When you call a set function in a component, React automatically updates the child components inside

 state is private to a component that defines it, you cannot update the Parent's state directly from the Child component 

define function in parent component, pass that function to child as a prop 

Calling the 'setState' function lets React know the state of the component has changed. This will trigger a re-render of the components that use the 'state' state as well as its child components

Avoid storing redundant state: can one state be calculated from another?  

Keys 
When a list is re-rendered, React takes each list item’s key and searches the previous list’s items for a matching key. If the current list has a key that didn’t exist before, React creates a component. If the current list is missing a key that existed in the previous list, React destroys the previous component. If two keys match, the corresponding component is moved.

Keys tell React about the identity of each component, which allows React to maintain state between re-renders. If a component’s key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created with a new state.

key is a special and reserved property in React. When an element is created, React extracts the key property and stores the key directly on the returned element. Even though key may look like it is passed as props, React automatically uses key to decide which components to update. There’s no way for a component to ask what key its parent specified.

It’s strongly recommended that you assign proper keys whenever you build dynamic lists. If you don’t have an appropriate key, you may want to consider restructuring your data so that you do.

Array Index as Key 
If no key is specified, React will report an error and use the array index as a key by default. Using the array index as a key is problematic when trying to re-order a list’s items or inserting/removing list items. Explicitly passing key={i} silences the error but has the same problems as array indices and is not recommended in most cases.

Keys do not need to be globally unique; they only need to be unique between components and their siblings.

Keys do  not need to be explicitly defined in custom component props. You can use them to give components a stable identity.
For example, when change the payment option selection in the checkout page, the billing form would not re-render. Without adding 
a key property to the billing form props, in the invocation of the <BillingForm/> i add a key property <BillingForm key={selection.id}
so that when the selection changed, and subsequently the id changed, react would know to rerender the component 


Functional Components 
Remember to use Functional components only when there are no dependencies between components or there aren't many! 

Components: 
since components are functions -> you can modify what parameters they take and what they return 
can be defined as classes, 

Selector 
function QuantityDropdown() {
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState("1");

  const handleChange = (event: { target: { value: string } }) => {
    console.log(event.target.value);
    setQuantity(event.target.value);
    console.log(quantity);
  };

  return (
    <select
      value={quantity}
      onChange={handleChange}
      className="p-2 text-center w-12"
    >
      {[...Array(200)].map((_, i) => (
        <option key={i} value={i + 1}>
          {i + 1}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
}

---------------------- hooks -----------------------

context 
use smaller contexts to reduce number of unnecessary renders: create contexts that preside over 
specific modules and components can explicitly state if id depends on states in the context provided 
- this means you create separate instances of contexts with in a single component if it relies on 
different states, but the components that rely on one or the other are safe from re-renders 

context tracks value using simple equality: 
combine context with useMemo and useCallback in context provider definitions so that functions and states 
don't trigger additional renders

updating state 

- Q: can you explain the difference between the following two functions: 
const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setOrder({ ...order, order_name: e.target.value });
} 

  const handleSelect = (configOption: string) => {
setOrderItem((prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  glassType: configOption,
}));

A: The two functions, handleInputChange and handleSelect, serve different purposes and handle state updates in different ways within a React component. 
Here's a breakdown of their differences:

1: Purpose and Parameters:
handleInputChange is designed to handle input change events, typically from an <input> element. It receives an event object (e) of type React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>, 
which contains information about the change event, including the new value of the input.
handleSelect, on the other hand, is designed to handle selection changes, possibly from a dropdown menu or a similar component. 
It directly receives the selected option (configOption) as a string parameter.

2. State Update Mechanism:
handleInputChange directly updates the state by spreading the current order object and overriding the order_name property with the new value from the input field (e.target.value). This approach is straightforward and is used when the new state depends directly on the event's target value.
handleSelect uses a functional update form to set the new state. It receives the previous state (prev) as a parameter and returns the new state. This pattern is particularly useful when the new state depends on the previous state. In this case, it spreads the previous orderItem state and updates the glassType property with the selected option.

3. Use Cases:
handleInputChange is typically used in text inputs where the user types in data. It's a common pattern for handling form inputs in React.
handleSelect is more suited for handling selections from a list of options, such as dropdowns or radio buttons, where the value is directly provided rather than being part of an event object.

4. State Being Updated:
It's also worth noting that these functions update different pieces of state: handleInputChange updates an order object, specifically its order_name property, while handleSelect updates an orderItem object, specifically its glassType property. This implies they are managing different aspects of the application's state, possibly related to different parts of a form or different forms altogether.
In summary, handleInputChange is tailored for text input changes, directly using the event's target value to update the state, while handleSelect is designed for selections, using the functional update form to safely update the state based on its previous value.


- Q: can you go into more detail about how the functional update form works

A: The functional update form in React is used to update the state based on the previous state in a more reliable way. 
This approach is particularly useful when the new state depends on the old state. 
It ensures that you are working with the most current state, especially in cases where state updates may be asynchronous or if there are multiple state updates happening in close succession.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the functional update form works in the provided code snippet:

Context and State Management: The code snippet is using a context (useProductContext) to manage global state across the application. 
This context likely provides a way to update a specific part of the global state, in this case, the order item.

The setOrderItem Function: This function is used to update the order item in the global state. It is obtained from the useProductContext hook, 
indicating that setOrderItem is designed to modify the state related to the product order.

Functional Update Syntax: When setOrderItem is called within handleSelect, it uses a function (prev => {...}) as its argument instead of 
directly passing the new state object. This function receives the previous state (prev) as its parameter.

Updating Based on Previous State: Inside the function, the previous state (prev) is spread (...prev) to copy all existing properties of the 
order item into a new object. This ensures that all other properties of the order item remain unchanged except for the one being updated.

Setting New State: The glassType property of the order item is then updated with the configOption argument passed to handleSelect. 
This effectively creates a new state object for the order item, with the glassType property set to the selected option.

Ensuring Current State: By using the functional update form, React guarantees that prev represents the most current state at the time of update, 
even if there have been multiple setOrderItem calls or other state updates.

Result: The result is a new state for the order item, with the updated glassType, which is then set as the new state through the context. 
This method ensures that state updates are reliable and based on the most current state information.

This approach is particularly useful in complex applications where state updates may depend on previous state values or when dealing with asynchronous state updates.


- Q: would it be safer to use the functional update form pattern in the handleInputChange function? 

Yes, using the functional update form is safer, especially when the new state depends on the old state. 
This ensures that the state update is always based on the most current state, avoiding potential bugs 
due to state updates being asynchronous. Here's how you can modify the handleInputChange function to use the functional update form:

const handleInputChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setOrder((currentOrder) => ({ ...currentOrder, order_name: e.target.value }));
};

The currentOrder variable in the handleInputChange function is defined as a parameter to the arrow function passed to setOrder. 
This syntax is used for the functional update form of the state setter function (setOrder in this case) provided by React's useState 
hook or a similar custom hook (like useProductContext in your code).

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

setOrder is a function that updates the state of order. It's provided by the useProductContext hook, which likely uses React's useState or useReducer under the hood to manage the state of the order.
When you call setOrder with a function as an argument (instead of directly passing the new state), React invokes this function with the current state as its argument. This is what currentOrder represents.
Inside this function, you can safely read currentOrder (which is the current state of order at the time the update is applied) and return the new state based on it. This pattern ensures that the update is always based on the most up-to-date state, avoiding potential issues with asynchronous state updates.
In your specific case, currentOrder is not defined elsewhere in your code; it's dynamically provided by React at the time setOrder is called. This pattern is particularly useful when the new state depends on the old state, as it ensures that the update is always accurate, even if there have been other updates to the state in the meantime.

------------------------------------ NextJS ------------------------------------
routing conventions 
creating a folder with parenthesis allows you to create a shared layout, without adding another segment to the URL 
app -> auth -> login -->> localhost:3000/auth/login 
app -> (auth) -> login -->> localhost:3000/login 
_foldername: the '_' tells nextjs to omit this route 

Dev builds: 
  to generate a build to look for build errors, run 'npm run build' 
  - if it hangs or gives an 'EPERM' error, check that you don't have a nextjs server running 

Server Actions are not limited to <form> and can be invoked from event handlers, useEffect, third-party libraries, and other form elements like <button> 


Server actions 
Good to know: In HTML, you'd pass a URL to the action attribute. This URL would be the destination where your form data should be submitted (usually an API endpoint).

However, in React, the action attribute is considered a special prop - meaning React builds on top of it to allow actions to be invoked.

Behind the scenes, Server Actions create a POST API endpoint. This is why you don't need to create API endpoints manually when using Server Actions.

How are actions handled differently than an async fetch function? look at data and actions files 

how is FormData something we have access to but don't explicitly pass in an action  

best practices: 
  server actions are good for updating or deleting, but slow for fetching 

FORMS
- using server actions in forms provides 'progressive enhancement'  
- progressive enhancement means the page can work with or without JavaScript enabled. For forms, using the useFormState hook enables progressive enhancement 


-server-side functions (like your fetchTestOrders function) are meant to be called on the server-side only. This is because they often require 
access to environment variables or resources that are only available on the server-side, such as a database connection string.
If you're trying to call fetchTestOrders from a client-side component, you'll need to create an API route that calls this function and returns the data. 
Then, in your client-side component, you can fetch data from this API route.
ex: 
// pages/api/testOrders.ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { fetchTestOrders } from '../../data';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    try {
      const orders = await fetchTestOrders();
      res.status(200).json(orders);
    } catch (err) {
      res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
    }
  } else {
    res.status(405).json({ message: 'Method not allowed' });
  }
}

then in the client component, fetch the data from the API route 
const res = await fetch('/api/testOrders');
const orders = await res.json();

Props from layout to Page components 
- what is the purpose of the [key: string]: any; in 
type ChildComponentProps = 
  { 
    updateSelections?: (selection: string) => void; 
    [key: string]: any; 
  };
- The [key: string]: any; line in the ChildComponentProps type definition is an index signature. 
In TypeScript, an index signature is used to describe objects that might have an unknown number of properties of a certain type.
- In this case, [key: string]: any; means that in addition to the updateSelections property, a ChildComponentProps object can have any number of 
additional properties, as long as their keys are strings. The type of these additional properties is any, which means they can be of any type.
- This is useful when you want to allow flexibility in the objects that can be used as ChildComponentProps, while still 
enforcing that certain properties (like updateSelections) exist.

Image 
statically import the image: import Logo from 'logo path';
  - here the image file is stored next ot the component from where it is imported.
  during build, nextjs will move it to dist folder, determine width and height, 
  and set it to the component. this helps avoid layout shift during image loading 
  - Warning: Dynamic await import() or require() are not supported. 
  The import must be static so it can be analyzed at build time.
a path string: 
  - here nextjs thinks this is a remote image and it should be loaded from either next public 
  folder or some remote location. in this case height and width must be set manually or 
  configure remote patterns if you want to enable image next optimization

auth 
middleware 
middleware is not nextauth specific, it is nextjs specific 
Adding auth to your Middleware is optional, but recommended to keep the user session alive.
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher 


<SessionProvider> must wrap the children using useSession() - however all pages in the 
layout using <SessionProvider> must be server components - 



scripts 
dev: runs next dev to start Next.js in development mode.
build: runs next build to build the application for production usage.
start: runs next start to start a Next.js production server.
lint: runs next lint to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.

classes vs types for data modeling - declarative code 

classes 
imperative code describes the steps that the runtime must take to initialize an object
declarative code describes the state of the initialized object

How we instantiated const user: User = { above 
is declarative; we're declaring the object in its full state. 
Imperative code, on the other hand, declares the object, then describes all of the steps to build it: 

-
immutable practices
You can't really even test test a unit. It might work in a unit test without the other parts, but if other parts modify it, then your test is useless. 
It becomes impossible to even identify all of the code paths. 
Conversely, code using immutable practices grows in complexity linearly. 
This piece always takes this value in and sends that value out. Tested, done, and on to the next part.

- 
creating custom types: 
optional fields vs nullable fields:
  Optional Properties (?):
    Use when a property is not always required and can be omitted.
    Useful for optional data, partial updates, and default values.
 
  Nullable Properties (| null):
    Use when a property is required but can explicitly be set to null.
    Useful for explicit nullability, state representation, and API responses.

-
custom types best practices:
  

-
{...rest} used in props 
rest is not a property that you define in your interface. Typescript automatically infers the type from the remainder properties (those you don't include in your destructure syntax

-
if you type an object, such as the expected shape of the data in a fetch function, TS will expect that predefined type and it will show on 
hover over the object. However, 'typeof' will actually check. 
ex. 
export async function getBillingInfoById(user_id: string) {
  try {
    const billingInfoData = await sql<BillingInfo>`
      SELECT * FROM billing_info 
      WHERE user_id=${user_id}`;

    console.log( typeof billingInfoData.rows[0].billing_addr); // here typeof prints 'string'
    return billingInfoData.rows.map(row => ({
      ...row,
      billing_addr: JSON.parse(row.billing_addr)// here i get a TS error saying "Argument of type 'Address' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'."
    }));

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch billing info:', error);
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch billing info.');
  }
}

-
i was getting the following error and over looked what the message was saying: 
Type '(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) => void' is not assignable to type '(value: string) => void'.
  Types of parameters 'e' and 'value' are incompatible.
    Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>'.ts(2322)
index.d.mts(14, 5): The expected type comes from property 'onValueChange' which is declared here on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & SelectProps'

this was thrown by <Select onValueChange={handlePaymentOptionChange}> 
where handlePaymentOptionChange was defined as 
  const handlePaymentOptionChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) => {
    const selectedBillingOption = billingOptions.find(
      (billingOption) => billingOption.id === Number(e.target.value)
    );
    setOrder((prevOrder) => ({
      ...prevOrder,
      billing_option: selectedBillingOption,
    }));
  };

  what the error was saying was that onValueChange expects a function of type (value: string) => void
  and i was giving it a function of type (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>) => void 

  the Select component used here is a custom component that handles its own state and passes the value 
  directly to the function, bypassing the need to handle the event and event.target ourselves 

-
Bracket Notation (order["billing_option"]):

Allows access to properties using a string. The string can be a variable, which makes this syntax more dynamic.
Useful when the property name is not a valid identifier, such as containing spaces or starting with a digit, or when it's a reserved keyword.
Can be used to access properties with names that are determined at runtime.
Dot Notation (order.billing_option):

More concise and easier to read for accessing known properties with valid identifier names.
Cannot be used with property names that are not valid identifiers (e.g., containing spaces, starting with digits, or reserved keywords).
The property name must be known at compile time.

------------------------------------ JavaScript ------------------------------------
.slice() can be used to create a copy of an array 
nextSquares = Squares.slice()

Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement. Later in this tutorial, 
you will implement a “time travel” feature that lets you review the game’s history and “jump back” to past moves. 
This functionality isn’t specific to games—an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement for apps. 
Avoiding direct data mutation lets you keep previous versions of the data intact, and reuse them later.

There is also another benefit of immutability. By default, all child components re-render automatically 
when the state of a parent component changes. This includes even the child components that weren’t affected by the change. 
Although re-rendering is not by itself noticeable to the user (you shouldn’t actively try to avoid it!), 
you might want to skip re-rendering a part of the tree that clearly wasn’t affected by it for performance reasons. 
Immutability makes it very cheap for components to compare whether their data has changed or not. 
You can learn more about how React chooses when to re-render a component in the memo API reference.

when creating new arrays we can use the spreader operator 
- You can read the ...history spread syntax as “enumerate all the items in array”.

JavaScript supports closures which means an inner function (e.g. handleClick) has access to variables and functions 
defined in a outer function (e.g. Board). The handleClick function can read the squares state and call the setSquares 
method because they are both defined inside of the Board function - to my understanding, 'closures' is what allows nested 
functions to access the constants and states defined in the outer function 

when passing functions, you just pass the name. when you include the parenthesis function() you are calling it. 
This can cause infinite loops when calling functions instead of passing them when trying to pass them as props, 
causing the component to re-render, which changes the state, which triggers another re-render and so on 

when passing a function as a prop, and you need a parameter, use arrow functions so as not to call the function when rendering the component 
the code after the => “arrow” will run, calling handleClick(0).
so instead of <Component value={someValue} onClick={handleClick(0)} >
use arrow function 
 <Component value={someValue} onClick={() => handleClick(0)} >


------------------------------------ JSX ------------------------------------
wrap elements in Link, rather than putting Link in an element: this way, if you put a button in a link, the whole button is clickable 
  this was how I resolved the Edit Order button bug 

<form> has: input, dropdown, input of type number and radio, cancel, and submit 

<><>: fragments can be used to avoid unnecessarily adding extra nodes to the DOM

schema 
  onDelete: 
  NO ACTION (default): Prevents deletion of a parent row if there are related rows in the child table. 
  The DELETE operation will fail.
  * RESTRICT: Similar to NO ACTION, prevents deletion of parent row if there are dependent rows in child table.
  * SET DEFAULT: If a parent row is deleted, the foreign key column in child table will be set to its default value. If no default value exists, the DELETE operation fails. 
  * SET NULL: When a parent row is deleted, the foreign key column in child table will be set to NULL (requires the column to allow NULL values). 
  * CASCADE: Deletes all corresponding rows in the child table when parent row is deleted.These actions can be specified using the references() second argument. The type definition for these actions is:

------------------------------------ Auth ------------------------------------

JWT vs Session(cookies)
Session 
In the session based authentication, the server will create a session for 
the user after the user logs in. The session id is then stored on a 
cookie on the user’s browser. While the user stays logged in, the cookie 
would be sent along with every subsequent request. The server can then 
compare the session id stored on the cookie against the session information 
stored in the memory to verify user’s identity and sends response 
with the corresponding state!

JWT 
Many web applications use JSON Web Token (JWT) instead of sessions for 
authentication. In the token based application, the server creates JWT 
with a secret and sends the JWT to the client. The client stores 
the JWT (usually in local storage) and includes JWT in the header 
with every request. The server would then validate the JWT with 
every request from the client and sends response.

The biggest difference here is that the user’s state is not stored on the server, 
as the state is stored inside the token on the client side instead. 
Most of the modern web applications use JWT for authentication for reasons 
including scalability and mobile device authentication.

If we expect a lot of users, or want to minimize load on the server, use toke 
authentication, since the token is stored on the client side 

Care must be taken to ensure only the necessary information is included in 
JWT and sensitive information should be omitted to prevent XSS security attacks.

------------------------------------ Authjs ------------------------------------ 
TODO: in what case do we need export const runtime = "edge" 

middleware 
middleware is not nextauth specific, it is nextjs specific 
Adding auth to your Middleware is optional, but recommended to keep the user session alive. 

from edge compatibility section 
https://authjs.dev/getting-started/migrating-to-v5 

While Auth.js strictly uses standard Web APIs (and thus can run in any 
environment that supports them), some libraries or ORMs 
(Object-Relational Mapping) packages that you rely on might not be ready yet. 
In this case, you can split the auth configuration into multiple files.

Auth.js supports two session strategies. When you are using an adapter, 
it will default to the database strategy. Unless your database and its 
adapter is compatible with the Edge runtime/infrastructure, you will not be 
able to use the "database" session strategy.

So for example, if you are using an adapter that relies on an ORM/library that
is not yet compatible with Edge runtime(s) below is an example where we 
force the jwt strategy and split up the configuration so the library 
doesn’t attempt to access the database in edge environments, 
like in the middleware.

when using an ORM/library that is not edge compatible, we will not have access to callbacks 
and events in the auth.ts file, which we normally would be able to use if our db was compatible 
with the edge.  NextJS Middleware works on the edge, and so if you want to use Middleware and 
somethihng like Prisma, which is not edge compatible, we have to separate auth.ts into two files:
auth.ts and auth.config.ts ------------- 05-08-2024
-----------------------
EX: Create an auth.config.ts file which exports an object containing your Auth.js configuration options. 
You can put all common configuration here which does not rely on the adapter. 
Notice this is exporting a configuration object only, we’re not calling NextAuth() here.
----
due to prisma's incompatability with edge, this is the file 
that triggers the nextjs middleware 
while auth.ts uses prisma adapter 

auth.config.ts 
import GitHub from "next-auth/providers/github"
import type { NextAuthConfig } from "next-auth"
 
export default { providers: [GitHub] } satisfies NextAuthConfig

server side login uses redirect() client side login uses callbackURL()
--------------------------
EX: 
Next, create an auth.ts file and add your adapter and the jwt session strategy there. 
This is the auth.ts configuration file you will import from in the rest of your application, other than in the middleware.
auth.ts 
import NextAuth from "next-auth"
import { PrismaAdapter } from "@auth/prisma-adapter"
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"
import authConfig from "./auth.config"
 
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
 
export const { handlers, auth } = NextAuth({
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  session: { strategy: "jwt" },
  ...authConfig,
})  ------------- 05-08-2024

------------------------------------ styling ------------------------------------ 

use h-screen instead of h-full

background image - can set to scroll or be fixed 

- CSS 
absolute units like cm, mm, in, pt, and pc should not be used: they are only effective for very high definition devices 

stick to rem, em, px, and % 
vw - 1/100 of window's width 
vh - 1/100 of window's height 

padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.
border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.
margin, the space around the outside of the border.

Something else you might like to try is styling a paragraph when it comes directly after a heading at the 
same hierarchy level in the HTML. To do so, place a + (an next-sibling combinator) between the selectors. 

/* selects any <span> that is inside a <p>, which is inside an <article>  */
article p span {
}

/* selects any <p> that comes directly after a <ul>, which comes directly after an <h1>  */
h1 + ul + p {
}

- css functions 
some properties have functions you can use for values such as: 
width: calc() 
transform: rotate(), 
color: rgb()
background-image: gradient()

@rules (at-rules)
provide instruction for behavior such as conditional styling 
@import can import a stylesheet into another stylesheet 
@media is used to create media queries for conditional styling 
for browser viewports wider than 30 em, apply a blue background: 
@media (min-width: 30em) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}

can set fallback styles by defining them earlier in ruleset 
.box {
  width: 500px; //if a browser doesn't support calc, then it'll fall back to 500px 
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
}

not sure if this applies to css in react or through tailwind 
Warning: One less obvious aspect of using CSS shorthand is how omitted values reset. A value not specified in CSS shorthand 
reverts to its initial value. This means an omission in CSS shorthand can override previously set values.

- DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up 

------------------------------------ tailwind ------------------------------------ 
for some grid like component - take a look at the OrderSummar.tsx component for example: 
need to make some container fit minimum space required by content, but the content varies 
and the container size needs be uniform 
- use flex and give flex direction on outer container(<div></div>) then flex-grow in the inner container 


  function orderItemDisplay() {
    return (
      <section className="border rounded-md my-4">
        <div className="flex justify-between border-r">
          <div className="flex flex-col bg-slate-100 w-full">
            <h2 className="border p-4">Description</h2>
            <div className="bg-white border p-4">{descriptionFormatter()}</div>
          </div>
          <div className="flex flex-col bg-slate-100 w-full">
            <h2 className="border p-4">Dimensions</h2>
            <div className="bg-white border p-4 flex-grow">
              {dimensionsFormatter()}
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="flex flex-col bg-slate-100 w-full">
            <h2 className="border p-4">Fabrication</h2>
            <div className="flex-grow bg-white border p-4">
              Fabrication Options
            </div>

          <div className="flex flex-col bg-slate-100">
            <h2 className="border p-4">Quantity</h2>

-best practices for data validation 
Best practices for user input validation and sanitization include:

1. Validate Input Format and Type: 
Ensure that the input matches the expected format and type. Use libraries like Zod for structured data validation to enforce these rules.

2. Sanitize Input: 
Remove or escape harmful characters that could be used for SQL injection, XSS attacks, etc. Libraries like DOMPurify (for browser environments) or sanitize-html (Node.js) can help with HTML input.

3. Use Schema Validation: 
For complex data structures, use schema validation (e.g., Zod, Joi, or Yup) to validate the structure and content of the data.

4. Enforce Business Logic Rules: 
Beyond format and type, ensure the input adheres to your application's business rules (e.g., a user's age must be over 18).

5. Limit Input Size: 
Set reasonable limits on the size of the input to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

6. Client-Side Validation for UX: 
Use client-side validation to provide immediate feedback to the user. This improves the user experience but should not be relied upon for security.

7. Server-Side Validation for Security: 
Always validate and sanitize input on the server side before processing or storing it. This is your last line of defense against malicious input.

8. Use Prepared Statements for Database Queries: 
To prevent SQL injection, use prepared statements and parameterized queries when interacting with databases.

9. Regularly Update Validation Libraries: 
Keep your validation and sanitization libraries up to date to protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities.

10. Log Validation Failures: 
Monitor and log validation failures to detect potential attack attempts.

Regarding where to perform validation and sanitization:

Client-Side Validation: Is primarily for improving user experience. It provides immediate feedback 
but can be bypassed by an attacker.
Server-Side Validation: Is crucial for security. It ensures that even if client-side validation is bypassed, 
the application does not process malicious input.
In your case, since you're already using Zod for data validation, you're following a good practice for structuring and validating 
your data. However, ensure that you also sanitize user inputs, especially those that will be included in HTML or database queries, 
and always perform these checks on the server side to ensure security.

--------------------------------------- Git ---------------------------------------

git error: cannot lock ref ''
i created a new branch auth/auth-proviers and when i tried to push or publish the branch 
i got the cannot lock ref error. it didn't like my auth/ ref because on remote the auth/
folder didn't exist but there was a branch named auth and the refs were getting mixed up 
I deleted the auth branch from remote, ran git remote prune origin, then tried to push 
and set upstream for auth/auth-providers and it worked 

-------------------------------------- Environment variables ----------------------------------- 
The greater React ecosystem treats NODE_ENV as a convention, only permitting three (3) values:

production: When your application is built with next build
development: When your application is run with next dev
test: When your application is being tested (e.g. jest)


dotenv is just for managing env variables during development, allowing you to test production 
without actually having to be in production. it is not used in deployed production environment
