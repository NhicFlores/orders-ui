looking at stackoverflow, threads on npm and nextjs github pages, and reddit threads, most people were saying it was a node module issue.
The suggestion was to install the latest versions of npm and node 

FIX: 
tag the file using bcrypt as a server component 'use server 'I was using bcrypt in server actions, but I hadn't tagged the file with the 'use server' tag

after adding form validation with safeParse in authentication server action I got this error in the useFormStatus hook 

No overload matches this call.

after creating the auth-merge branch and resetting the commits to have one 
clean commit go into dev then main, i got the following error in the browser 
after trying to sign in a new user. I got the credentials wrong, then tried again 
and the browser showed the following build error. 
next time I'll make sure to copy the build stack as well 

TypeError: originalFactory is undefined

i was unable to recreate the error. I looked it up and didn't find anything useful 

i ran npm i just to see if it was a module thing since i had merged a bunch of commits 
into the dev branch. it didn't show any updates or changes. I tried again and wasn't able 
to recreate it. I went ahead and merged to main. there were no build errors in main, 
or any of the preview deployments for the dev, auth, or register-user branches
