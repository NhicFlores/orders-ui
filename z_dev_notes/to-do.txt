X fetch for drafts, quotes 
X pages, routes for drafts, quotes 
X configure table for drafts/quote client view

create user profile 
	- page, routes
		new profile, edit user  
	- fetch function 
	- update, insert, delete server actions 
		this is from client perspective: create one profile for yourself 
	-update user table in db 
		update fields and types 
	- consider one customer can have many users - keep many user_ide with email and password attached to 'customers' which stores company, shipping, billing, etc 
		this won't work(smoothly) in the case that different users at different companies handle orders for different work sites
		maybe we need user, company, and customer to allow for user to choose default order information 

definitions for table entities separate definitions into multiple files  
	users need updated 
	products need created 

move header to layout
change status to a client side read only field 

define data fetching pattern - server actions
form submission pattern - allow for inline editing 

Low Priority 
choose license 

import icons  
font awesome 
ant design 
lucide react

form: saving info -> output order format 

buttons on new order page- finish later, next, and submit buttons should do the same thing just storing different tags 

styling
maybe find some pictures to put in the background 


definitions.ts - data types for tables:; customers 
    draft table everything nullable - no draft table - just a status on an order 

server components 
   can reuse other components: change data types 

use tooltips to see details when hovering over table like seeing the custoomer id when 
hovering on customer name 

deleting items: should have a deleted folder (and table) that will hold onto stuff for like 15 days or something 
archiving items to clean out historical data from current: ex. past customers - dont want to delete them but 
we don't need them in working data 

global definitions for paths to consolidate them and avoid spelling errors
