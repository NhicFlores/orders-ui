reusable components: buttons, rows, banners, 

form: saving info -> output order format 

button that inserts new order - finish later, next, submit should do the same thing just storing different tags 

style page - center information 
maybe find some pictures to put in the background 


definitions.ts - data types for tables:; customers 
    draft table everything nullable 

server components 
   can reuse other components: change data types 

use tooltips to see details when hovering over table like seeing the custoomer id when 
hovering on customer name 

deleting items: should have a deleted folder (and table) that will hold onto stuff for like 15 days or something 
archiving items to clean out historical data from current: ex. past customers - dont want to delete them but 
we don't need them in working data 

global definitions for paths to consolidate them and avoid spelling errors 

Loose project structure (will require some refactoring)
